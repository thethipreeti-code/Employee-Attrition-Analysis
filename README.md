## 🛠️ Project Workflow

### 🔹 1. Data Cleaning (Excel)
- Removed unnecessary columns.
- Created ~8 new columns using Excel formulas.
- Example: Added a *Salary Band* column to categorize salary levels (Low, Medium, High).
- Other columns include *Age Group, **Attrition Category, and **Manager Experience Group*, etc.

### 🔹 2. SQL Analysis (MySQL)
- Imported the cleaned dataset into MySQL.
- Executed 25+ queries using:
  - Basic filtering
  - Aggregate functions
  - Joins
  - Window functions
- Extracted meaningful metrics such as:
  - Average salary by department
  - Attrition rate by job role
  - Years at company vs attrition patterns

### 🔹 3. Power BI Dashboard
- Built an interactive dashboard with filters (Gender, Department, Role).
- Created KPIs using DAX (e.g., Attrition %, Average Salary, etc.).
- Designed a 3-page dashboard:
  - Overall Attrition View
  - Female-Specific Insights
  - Male-Specific Insights
